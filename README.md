## Developing 🛠

After you've cloned/forked/whatever the repo, you can do this:

```bash
npm run install
npm run dev
# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Tests 🧪

Tests run on [github actions](https://github.com/DennisSmuda/dennissmuda-website/actions), everytime a PR gets opened.

To run playwright locally, I recommend the official [vs code plugin] - which is amazingly convenient - you can also just run `npm t`.
