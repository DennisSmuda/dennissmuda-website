title: about me

Nice to meet you! 👋 My name is
<span class="keyword">Dennis</span>
and I have been working as a
<span class="color-change font-medium">web developer</span>
for the
<em>last {{ new Date().getFullYear() - 2015 }}+ years</em>. I have worked on
projects (mainly UI-focused) ranging from small company and personal websites to full fledged web applications.

I deeply enjoy building things that can be interacted with, especially if
it's something <span class="emphasis">fun</span>
or <em>useful</em> <span class="opacity-50">... or both!</span>
