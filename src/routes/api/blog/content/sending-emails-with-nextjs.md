## Goal

Sending E-Mails with Api-Routes in Next.js

## First Steps

I assume you are somewhat familar with next.js and react in general. I highly recommend checking out the [excellent docs page](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) the next team has put out.

```jsx
export function LoginPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World<h1>
      <p>Lorem Ipusm</p>
    <div/>
  )
}
```
